# Moral AI

Moral AI is a Python and Pygame simulation program designed to explore and understand agent behaviors within various scenarios. This project focuses on unveiling the intricate dynamics that underlie different interactions, with a distinctive emphasis on ethical considerations in AI decision-making.

## Project Overview

Moral AI seeks to address the complex landscape of AI decision-making by simulating scenarios where agents interact in a variety of ways. By providing a platform to explore collaborative and competitive situations, this project aims to shed light on the ethical dimensions of AI choices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. If you don't have Pygame, you can install it using the following command:

   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

### Running the Simulation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Run the simulation program:

   ```
   python user.py
   ```
   
## Features and Usage

The Moral AI simulation program allows users to:
- Observe agent behaviors in various scenarios.
- Explore how different choices impact the moral outcomes of the interactions.
- Gain insights into the ethical dimensions of AI decision-making.

## Technologies Used

This project is developed using:
- Python: Core programming language.
- Pygame: Library for building interactive games and simulations.

## Simulation Details

The simulation program uses a combination of algorithms and rules to govern agent behaviors. Agents interact with each other based on predefined scenarios, with their choices and actions influencing the moral outcomes of the simulation.
